# Decentralized Credit Scoring Agent








## Project Description
Overview
The Decentralized Credit Scoring Agent is an AI Agent developed using the Giza SDK. It manages a smart strategy built on top of a decentralized protocol and interacts with smart contracts based on Verifiable ML Model predictions. The agent follows a predefined logic to execute on-chain transactions based on the output of a verifiable ML Model.

Problem Statement
Traditional credit scoring systems often suffer from biases and lack transparency. Decentralized credit scoring aims to address these issues by leveraging blockchain technology and machine learning models to provide fair, transparent, and verifiable credit scores.

Use Cases
Financial Agents: Algorithmic structured products, Arbitrage Agents, Insurance Agents, LP Automation Agents
Protocol Agents: Treasury management Agents, Reputation scoring Agents, Slashing Agents
Social Agents: Recommender Agents, Content mod Agents
Features
Interaction with smart contracts: The agent interacts with smart contracts to execute on-chain transactions based on credit scoring predictions.
Machine Learning integration: The agent utilizes machine learning models to make credit scoring predictions.
Verifiable ML Model predictions: The agent ensures the verifiability of ML model predictions through the use of blockchain technology.
Deployment
The Decentralized Credit Scoring Agent can be deployed on any testnet supported by the Giza SDK. Deployment involves deploying the agent's smart contracts and integrating them with the Giza SDK for interaction with the blockchain.

Business Case
The business case for the Decentralized Credit Scoring Agent lies in providing fair, transparent, and verifiable credit scores to individuals and entities. By leveraging blockchain technology and machine learning models, the agent aims to revolutionize the credit scoring industry and address issues of bias and lack of transparency in traditional credit scoring systems.

Functionality
The agent's functionality includes:

Fetching data: The agent fetches credit data from external sources.
Model training: The agent trains machine learning models on the fetched data.
Making predictions: The agent uses the trained models to make credit scoring predictions.
Interaction with smart contracts: The agent interacts with smart contracts to execute on-chain transactions based on the credit scoring predictions.
Attack Vectors
Data tampering: Attackers may attempt to tamper with the data used for training the machine learning models, leading to biased predictions.
Smart contract vulnerabilities: Smart contracts used by the agent may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to manipulate the agent's behavior.
Possible Improvements
Enhanced data validation: Implementing robust data validation mechanisms to detect and prevent data tampering.
Security auditing: Conducting security audits of smart contracts to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Conclusion
The Decentralized Credit Scoring Agent is a powerful tool for providing fair, transparent, and verifiable credit scores. By leveraging blockchain technology and machine learning models, the agent addresses the shortcomings of traditional credit scoring systems and paves the way for a more inclusive financial ecosystem.
